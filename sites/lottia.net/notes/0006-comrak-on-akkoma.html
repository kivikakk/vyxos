<p>First up: I‚Äôve never done more than toy with Elixir before, and never with Nix
or Rust, so this ‚Äúsimply stuff Nix, Elixir and Rust into a magic hat‚Äù trick was
guaranteed to be at least a little bit Fun‚Ñ¢. And it was! :)</p>
<p>Stock Akkoma uses <a href="https://github.com/pragdave/earmark">Earmark</a>, which
looks like a lovely library, but maybe a lil out of date and out of step with
CommonMark/GFM. <strong>We deserve <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak">Comrak</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Happily enough, a Google search revealed a Nathan Faucett had already done
most of the hard work of using Comrak from Elixir in
<a href="https://gitlab.com/nathanfaucett/ex-markdown"><code>ex-markdown</code></a>. Thank you! This never gets old.</p>
<p>Ported it for Comrak and <a href="https://github.com/rusterlium/rustler">Rustler</a>
changes in the last 5 years, and then learned about the various ways to
juggle Elixir and Mix releases/deps in Nix. <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/ex-markdown/compare/master...lottia">Several hundred lines of hack-ish
later</a> and
<code>ex-markdown</code> was now fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Special care was taken to ensure both <code>nix develop</code>- and <code>nix build</code>-based
builds work ‚Äî this one always wants to be able to quickly iterate in my checkout
without waiting all day for non-incremental builds, but at the end a <code>nix build</code>
should:</p>
<ul>
<li>match the behaviour of a clean <code>nix develop --command bash -c "mix deps.get &amp;&amp; mix test"</code>;</li>
<li>always cleanly succeed; and,</li>
<li>run <code>mix test</code> itself as a post-install check so we don‚Äôt get blindsided by
differences in the dev shell/closure-built artefact only when later using it
(i.e. in Akkoma).</li>
</ul>
<p>This required some finesse: we want to build the native Rust dependency as
usual when doing <code>nix build</code>, which means doing the usual Cargo/Nix dance
and compiling that artefact as its own derivation (and all its crate deps as
their own, etc. etc.). On the other hand, in <code>nix develop</code> we want the usual
compile-on-demand to happen. Happily, Rustler is portable enough to support this
workflow! (see the <code>MARKDOWN_NATIVE_SKIP_COMPILATION</code> env var.)</p>
<p>One tricky thing is the fucken Mix dependencies. The <code>ex-markdown</code> derivation
itself needs to introduce its own Mix deps to <code>beamPackages.buildMix</code> so it can
actually build and test. But that‚Äôs no good when we‚Äôre building Akkoma ‚Äî we want
to use a release-wide resolved version of those dependencies, with all BEAM deps
in the one closure and no overlap.</p>
<p>For now we hack it somewhat, and reproduce some of <code>ex-markdown</code>‚Äôs derivation in
our Akkoma fork ‚Äî <code>beamPackages</code> doesn‚Äôt have anything like <code>overrideBeamAttrs</code>
or <code>overrideMixAttrs</code> at the moment.
<a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/akkoma/compare/v3.10.4...lottia">There‚Äôs a fair bit more Nix</a>
involved therein.</p>
<p>We started with upstream Nixpkgs‚Äô Akkoma package definition (again, copying the
original as a base due to lack of override), add our <code>:markdown</code> package to the
<code>mixNixDeps</code> ‚Äî we pull the source, native package and toolchain deps through the
<code>ex-markdown</code> flake :)! ‚Äî, adjust the call-sites, and then as a cherry on top,
expose a NixOS module that sets <code>config.services.akkoma.package</code> to the package
exposed. Using the new Akkoma in my personal config is as simple as referring
the module.</p>
<p>And there you have it!</p>

<p>Having never really touched Elixir much, this was a reasonably intimidating
circus of interdependent parts to dive right into. It was super fun and ‚Äî as
usual ‚Äî I credit Nix with making this <em>at all</em> possible, and more importantly
<em>worthwhile</em>. The fact that I don‚Äôt have to worry about accumulating platform
tools (or getting them installed on the target server etc.) is only a small part
of it.</p>
<p>I did indeed spend quite a while fucking around with Making All This Shit Work
With Nix, but I‚Äôd probably have spent as long or longer if I was just doing
this on some pleb distro because of build artefacts left over from successive
attempts ‚Äî and of course, most of the work would be rendered null next time I
had to set up a new server! The amount of discovery (and number of dead ends) I
got to rebase into concrete learnings is <em>incredible</em>.</p>
<p>(I once again express my thanks to those who got me here ‚Äî especially
<a href="https://pony.social/@cadey">@cadey@pony.social</a> for putting the idea in my head
years ago, and my ex-qpf for using Nix in the year of our lord 2023, which was a
strong enough signal to finally Just Do It.)</p>
