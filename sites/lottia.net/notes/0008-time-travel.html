<h2>Start <a href="#start" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink to section" class="anchor">üîó</a> <a href="#top" aria-hidden="true" title="Back to top" class="anchor">‚Ü©</a></h2>
<p>In February I started writing my first RV32 core, <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/sae">Sae</a>. By the end of the
month, I had enough of one going to run some sample code compiled with GCC for
RV32I, interacting with UART via MMIO, which was such a nice feeling. It was
written in a very dumb manner ‚Äî meaning it used 95% of the UP5K and took 3
minutes to synthesise ‚Äî but on the other hand it ran pretty much at one cycle
per cycle! (I hadn‚Äôt pipelined instruction memory fetches, so it <em>didn‚Äôt</em>, but
that was the only thing standing in the way of that. It was written very, uh,
plainly.)</p>
<p>Next I wanted to tackle RV32C, and one thing I wasn‚Äôt happy with was <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/sae/blob/4faae64a780bf0521fc8aa73bf8cc7b70add193c/sae/rtl/rv32.py">how I was
actually defining the ISA</a>. It was very manual, and it felt like there
was a lot that could be extracted out in less ad-hoc ways, so that I didn‚Äôt then
have to repeat myself even more when adding RV32C, or e.g. making it possible to
define a thing called ‚ÄúRV32E‚Äù (which is just RV32I with 16 X registers instead
of 32) as a refinement of RV32I instead of repeating a whole bunch of code, and
then making that selectable as the basis for a core/hart. This also provided an
opportunity to expose more metadata for the built-in assembler and disassembler
used by the test suite.</p>
<p>I started to extract a bit of a ‚Äúconstruction kit‚Äù for ISAs, and as was my Python
style at the time, there was a <em>lot</em> of magic involved. One of the commits describes
redoing something <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/sae/commit/d23fdd79a948a7cc1f4c1edc94295e4f4cfe6bff">‚Äúwith just slightly less magic‚Äù</a>, but iunno, a lot
of magic follows in the commits after that one.</p>
<p>And then, on March 5, <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/sae/commit/666247bfea908253d2aa1aa5c2bd8b208fa231fd">a small ‚Äúwip‚Äù commit</a> is the last of the branch, with
some code that‚Äôs kind of half-there, half-nonsense, and the following intentionally
syntactically incomplete line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">             clone.xfrms.append(pipe)
<span class="gi">+            clone.asm_args. ## RESUME XXX GOOD LUCK</span></code></pre>

<h2>Change <a href="#change" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink to section" class="anchor">üîó</a> <a href="#top" aria-hidden="true" title="Back to top" class="anchor">‚Ü©</a></h2>
<p>At that stage I was about a month off moving to Estonia, and so all work
stopped. By the time I started to do HDL again, two months later, I‚Äôd decided
to stop using Amaranth entirely and
<a href="0007-amaranth-to-chisel.html">learned to do digital design in Chisel</a>, which was a big undertaking.
A lot of the machinery around the design needed to be implemented ‚Äî connecting
to resources on IO pins, the concept of building for different platforms, etc.
‚Äî a lot of the toolchain needed to be replaced/rebuilt, but the actual manner
of design changed a lot too. I‚Äôd taught myself HDL with Amaranth, and I sort
of retaught myself it with Chisel, grasping the fundamentals more clearly.</p>
<p>(I also wrote a framework for Chisel in this time, <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/chryse">Chryse</a>, which is where all
my non-project-specific bits went, including the replacements for what Amaranth
gave outside the HDL itself. I had a project framework for Amaranth, <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/hdx#rain">Rain</a>, so
Chryse was like Amaranth build‚Äôn‚Äôplatform plus Rain.)</p>
<p>Three-ish weeks ago, I started using Amaranth again, and it was time to see
where my old work was at. First, I ported everything new from Chryse back to
Rain, freeing it from its weird Nix flake and so giving it a new name, <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/niar">Niar</a>.
Then I ported my last Chisel project back to Amaranth, <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/ili9341spi">ili9341spi</a>, using it as
the basis for testing Niar. (It‚Äôs just a TFT LCD controller, rendering Conway‚Äôs
Game of Life.)</p>
<p>Once I‚Äôd gotten things to my satisfaction, it was time for my next project. I‚Äôd
remembered Sae as my last big project before moving/switching off Amaranth, but
my memory didn‚Äôt extend much further than that ‚Äî except maybe the atrocious
build times.</p>
<p>My next project wants a little CPU core of some kind in it, and I decided to be
responsible and actually bring Sae back to life with my new sensibilities, instead
of just starting fresh and having all that work sit there.</p>

<h2 title="Naturally sequent.">Necromancy <a href="#necromancy" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink to section" class="anchor">üîó</a> <a href="#top" aria-hidden="true" title="Back to top" class="anchor">‚Ü©</a></h2>
<p>There was the <code>main</code> branch, <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/sae/commit/f67fec675ff137eba41ca636b9f04d981784a7a1">last modified February 28</a>, and then 27
commits of WIP on the <code>rv32c</code> branch ending in the <code>RESUME XXX GOOD LUCK</code>
comment. I took one look at the code in that branch and I realised the comment
was extremely apposite. I didn‚Äôt have a clue what any of the existing magic
was doing, and I certainly didn‚Äôt understand what the final half-commit was
driving towards either. The tests were extremely broken, and so there was
nowhere really to get a foothold on it.</p>
<p>So it was back to February 28. First I ported it to Niar, which was uneventful,
and then added a <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/sae/commit/e48cc2778003023fea6037908e0cc3f9b0eb57fb">test using CXXRTL</a> to run the same thing we build for
the actual FPGA, which is <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/sae/blob/4faae64a780bf0521fc8aa73bf8cc7b70add193c/rv/shrimprw.c">this delightful little program</a>. Synthesis
still takes 3 minutes, and it turns out all but 10 seconds of this is in
place-and-route. CXXRTL elaboration and compile is much faster, and running real
RV code gives me more certainty than the (extensive but still artificial) unit
tests that I haven‚Äôt broken anything.</p>
<p>At this stage I could‚Äôve considered getting back onto the WIP, but the core
gateware design issue was pretty pressing: no matter how good an experience I
have of specifying an ISA, if I only have 260ish gates free, I‚Äôm not doing much
with it, and the build time sucks even if I can mostly test without it. (I don‚Äôt
want to be <em>discouraged</em> from putting it on the FPGA!)</p>
<pre><code>[2024-07-03 13:05:25,148] niar: DEBUG: starting synthesis/pnr
[2024-07-03 13:05:25,148] niar: INFO: [run]   execute_build

</code></pre>
<p>So instead I spent time fixing this, which meant separating the core out into
stages, defining an ALU instead of repeating the ops everywhere, putting the
registers into BRAM (that was 40% of the UP5K‚Äôs LCs right there), and generally
making the thing slower at runtime and tightening up some definitions in
exchange for 80x faster PNR and using a third of the logic resources. It‚Äôs at
least somewhat amenable to pipelining, which is something I‚Äôm going to enjoy
implementing later.</p>
<p>I proceeded methodically and generally did before-and-after builds of every
change, comparing the bytecount of the generated RTLIL for a rough idea of ‚Äúhow
much raw IL does the Amaranth input given produce‚Äù, synthesis plus PNR time, and
comparing <code>ICESTORM_LC</code> counts of the final design (or just cells reported by
Yosys where PNR was failing because the design got too big).</p>
<p>This is extremely fraught and open to misinterpretation, because Yosys‚Äô output
is optimised, and with many passes involved, there is no direct link between a
given change and the effect on output size. PNR is similar, especially when up
against resource limits, and so the whole thing requires investing not too much
importance in any one result. You‚Äôre just kinda vibing it out, making hypotheses
about what might be cheaper post-opt, and then, usually, trying to reason to
yourself why it wasn‚Äôt actually cheaper. There‚Äôs a lot of holding of judgment
because maybe you need to change <em>all</em> the things of class X before you can
observe the true difference between two methods.</p>
<p>A play-by-play of this whole process is included in the raw log with the
subheading <a href="0009-time-travel-raw.html#decombing">‚ÄúDecombing‚Äù</a>. At the entry
to this stage, synthesis took 2:47 and PNR completed with 5033/5280 (95%) of
<code>ICESTORM_LC</code>s used. We finished at synthesis taking 0:10 and using 2194/5280
(41%).</p>

<h2>Chrononautics <a href="#chrononautics" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink to section" class="anchor">üîó</a> <a href="#top" aria-hidden="true" title="Back to top" class="anchor">‚Ü©</a></h2>
<p>Now we were in a position to start understanding the refactor WIP.</p>
<p>Step one was rebasing the old branch onto the new. I‚Äôd refactored and moved
things around a lot (including e.g. using Amaranth‚Äôs new async testbench stuff),
so any commit that touched the existing gateware or testing infrastructure
conflicted, but these were nice little opportunities to understand pieces of
what I was doing in context. The branch itself had a lot of nice refactors
in other areas too, so by the time I‚Äôd finished rebasing, I felt in a fairly
good position, except for the fact that neither building it nor running any of
the tests worked because there was a syntax error in the core ISA definition
machinery.</p>
<p>The next step was to get it running, because I couldn‚Äôt hope to complete
whatever it was I was doing in March without understanding any of its context
‚Äî namely the entire new ISA kit ‚Äî and understanding a system is so much
easier when you can see it running.</p>
<p>To start with, I just commented out the broken line, and it ran, with 44/64
tests passing. Without much in the way of understanding everything around it, I
was able to identify something one specific case needed to happen right at that
same spot,  put together an ultra-specific hack in situ, and we got to 54/64.
At this point, I kind of understand what I was going for, but now I need to
understand everything else to know how to make it happen.</p>
<p>The way to do that turned out to be just reading the new code over and over
again, outlining it in natural language from the top down. The result of this
process is included in the raw log under the subheading <a href="0009-time-travel-raw.html#design">‚ÄúDesign‚Äù</a>, and by the
end of it, I‚Äôd recapitulated every decision made in coming up with it. The next
steps I‚Äôd imagined <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/sae/commit/456f51b6c0e1aeff93e77b3cf34a5f97f2b2f660">followed naturally</a>, and although I entered this stage with
no intention to continue to use this design (on account of its magic-ness), it
still made sense to me to finish my last WIP before turning my mind to simpler
design, since without a fully proven concept I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve grasped it enough
to actually design it again. This got us to 63/64 tests, with the last one being
the first (prospective) RVC test.</p>
<p>More than proving the concept, though, I just really enjoyed <em>finally</em>
completing that change, over 4 months later, in a completely different place and
time. Continuity in the face of countless discontinuities.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this branch doesn‚Äôt include much in the way of actual RV32C
support, since I got completely caught up with designing the new ISA kit using
the existing RV32I support as a basis. I think I won‚Äôt bother with that, though,
since it‚Äôll likely entail further support from the ISA kit, and in the current
design that means even more magic. Time to simplify.</p>
