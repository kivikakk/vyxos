      <p>The sender address bounced today, so I’m just publishing my reply here. Hope you
see it! :)</p>

<hr />

<p>Hiya &lt;3</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your email; it was really lovely to receive. (Markdown
ecosystem work is not very rewarding a lot of the time, lol :p)</p>

<p>But yeah — I don’t think there’s anything in particular you could do, and
that’s quite OK! The thought by itself is enough, thank you :) Financially I’m
completely fine. So I hope you get that Clojure gig and get money to make your
own life even cooler! (Throwback to that time I wrote a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130423114048/http://rouge.io/">Clojure impl in Ruby!</a>)</p>

<p>Be well &lt;3</p>

      <p>Content note: pain, bad mental health, health issues.</p>

<p><a href="/eesti/2024/04/11/early-nyonks/">Six months later</a>, we’re back. It’s sad — we were acclimating well,
met our neighbours, started riding all over the country, and then I started to
be in pain.</p>

<p>Any kind of pain is bad, but the body part(s) affected really define the flavour
of the impact it has, I guess, and this has been the first time I’ve had really
significant leg pain.  That’s sort of underselling it; it’s sometimes in my
knees, usually ankles, feet, and though it seems like it shouldn’t be related,
also in my elbows, fingertips, and even the sides of my neck, and it all feels
very much related.</p>

<p>Still, for the most part it’s in my lower legs, and it. is. constant. I went
back on nifedipine, since a Raynaud’s “diagnosis” last year had me try that
and it sort of helped during winter. My hands and feet are always really cold,
and they were worse than usual, so I was hopeful it’d help. Estonia only had
the <a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/sabs/Documents/2021-sn-001.pdf">“medium acting”</a> variant, and it felt a lot bumpier than the
modified-release ones in Australia.</p>

<p>After that didn’t help at all, it was time to see the doctor. And see the
doctor I did. And again, and again. And a physiotherapist. And an orthopaedist.
Two X-rays, two different kinds of strong anti-inflammatory, three weeks of
gabapentin, a month and a half of physio, and three months later in total and
not even the slightest improvement. Exercising didn’t help, resting didn’t help.
Ruled out referred back pain, inflammation, neuropathy, muscular.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the time between appointments started to stretch out, I guess as
folks returned from summer holidays, and I was just miserable. I hadn’t been
able to do much of anything in a long time, and the <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/jqfp5d/what_are_you_doing_this_week#c_hihjcw">healthcare system in
Estonia</a> was really making it hard. The pain on some days made me want
to beat whichever leg was hurting into a pulp, because that somehow was more
tractable and bearable.</p>

<p>So we’re back. I’ve had some relief since, in being able to switch back to
the modified-release nifedipine, as well as get back on an antidepressant —
duloxetine, both for the general sense of despair I’ve been accumulating this
last quarter of a year (!), and for its help with ?fibromyalgia. The pain is a
little bit more distant, but it’s still there and still getting worse.</p>

<p>Finally getting some blood tests confirmed it’s not something easy (anaemia,
B12 deficiency) or obvious (cancer, RF+ RA). My money is on COVID-related
vasculopathy, but I guess it’s not so easy to confirm, deny, or help. With some
amazing luck, I managed to score an early rheumatologist appointment (someone
had just cancelled), which then got bumped forward another week, so that’s now
tomorrow.</p>

<p>I can’t particularly have my hopes up — we’re up to 4 months now since this
started to intrude on my life. <a href="/2016/08/22/illness-1.html">Last time I had a new chronic illness</a>, it took more than a year for it to start subsiding regularly enough that
I could start to believe it might abate entirely. (It came back for months at a
time, years later.)</p>

<p>And unlike that time, this one isn’t only in my head: my legs and feet are
increasingly randomly surfacing bruises that don’t clear up for <em>months</em> at
a time. A few days ago while out to therapy, there was a particularly sharp
ache across the top of my left foot, and when I got home, I took my shoe off
and found that a vein had just turned completely black in a spot right there.
There’s a blue patch on the back of my right leg (the one that hurts less on
average!) that hasn’t gone away in the whole four months. And as my doctor here
said, it’s entirely possible that at the end of all our investigations, I’ll
still have this pain to manage, maybe indefinitely.</p>

<p>Which, y’know? That kind of thing just happens in life.</p>

      <p>It’s come to my attention that some folks don’t know my blog has an <a href="https://kivikakk.ee/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>!
This is kind of astonishing to me as it suggests people actually manually check
blogs for new posts sometimes?!</p>

<p>At any rate, it does, it’s just not linked anywhere explicitly — but it is
supported via <a href="https://dri.es/rss-auto-discovery">RSS autodiscovery</a>, which I just kind of .. assumed everyone
used, relied on, knew about? But apparently not!</p>

<p>I guess I’ll add a link, just in case. :)</p>

        Tüüpiautomaat: automated testing of a compiler and target against each other
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2024-08-06T00:00:00+10:00" class="post-date">06 Aug 2024</time>

    
      <p>I’m currently working on a bit of a <a href="https://github.com/charlottia/ava">long-winded project</a> to recapture
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC">QuickBASIC</a>, the environment I learned to program in, in a bit of
a novel way, while remaining highly faithful to the original. (I actually
started a related project <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/kyuubey">9 years ago</a> (!), and I’ll be able to reuse
some of what I did back then!)</p>

<p>The new project involves compiling the BASIC down into a bytecode suitable for
a stack machine, and an implementation of such a stack machine. Importantly,
there’ll soon be a second implementation which runs on a different architecture
entirely: namely, it’ll be an implementation <em>of</em> this architecture on an FPGA.
So the machine needs to be reasonably easy to implement in hardware — if it
simplifies the gateware design, I’ll happily take tradeoffs that involve making the
compiler more complicated, or the ISA more verbose.</p>

<p>The ISA started out with opcodes like:</p>

<div class="language-zig highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">Opcode</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">enum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">u8</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">PUSH_IMM_INTEGER</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0x01</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">PUSH_IMM_LONG</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0x02</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">PUSH_IMM_SINGLE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0x03</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">PUSH_IMM_DOUBLE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0x04</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">PUSH_IMM_STRING</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0x05</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">PUSH_VARIABLE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0x0a</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="c">// [...]</span>
    <span class="n">OPERATOR_ADD</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0xd0</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">OPERATOR_MULTIPLY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0xd1</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">OPERATOR_NEGATE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0xd2</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="c">// [...]</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the binary operations, the stack machine would pop off two elements, and then
look at the types of those elements to determine how to add them. This is easy to
do in Zig, but this is giving our core a lot of work to do — especially when we
consider how extensive the rules involved are:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-img/typeconversions.png" alt="Screenshot of QuickBASIC 4.5 open to the &quot;Type Conversions&quot; help page.
It's scrolled some way down and yet the screen is full of text describing how
operands are converted to the same degree of precision, and further how result
types may affect that." /></p>

<p>Ideally, the executing machine doesn’t <em>ever</em> need to check the type of a value
on the stack before doing something with it — the bytecode itself can describe
whatever needs to happen instead.</p>

<p>In other words, when compiling this<sup id="fnref:highlighting" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:highlighting" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div class="language-zig highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">42</span>       <span class="err">'</span> <span class="n">This</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">an</span> <span class="n">INTEGER</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">32768</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">32767</span><span class="p">).</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… instead of having an op stream like this:</p>

<div class="language-zig highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">PUSH_IMM_INTEGER</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">LET</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">PUSH_IMM_LONG</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">32800</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">LET</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">PUSH_VARIABLE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">PUSH_VARIABLE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">OPERATOR_SUBTRACT</span>     <span class="c">// runtime determines it must promote RHS and do LONG subtraction</span>
<span class="n">CAST_INTEGER</span>          <span class="c">// runtime determines it has a LONG to demote</span>
<span class="n">LET</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>— and so leaving the runtime environment to decide when to promote, or demote,
or coerce, and when to worry about under/overflow — we instead have this:</p>

<div class="language-zig highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">PUSH_IMM_INTEGER</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">PUSH_IMM_LONG</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">32800</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">LET</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">PUSH_VARIABLE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">PUSH_VARIABLE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">PROMOTE_INTEGER_LONG</span>     <span class="c">// compiler knows we're about to do LONG subtraction</span>
<span class="n">OPERATOR_SUBTRACT_LONG</span>
<span class="n">COERCE_LONG_INTEGER</span>      <span class="c">// compiler knows we're assigning to an INTEGER</span>
<span class="n">LET</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A proliferation of opcodes results, but crucially it means most operations
execute unconditionally, resulting in a far simpler design when it comes to
putting this on a chip.</p>

<p>The upshot of this design, however, is that the compiler needs a far greater degree
of awareness and ability:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It needs to be aware of what types the arguments to the binary operation are.</p>

    <p>In the example above, we have a LONG and an INTEGER. This appears trivial, but
we need to keep in mind that the arguments can be arbitrary expressions.</p>

    <p>We need this in order to determine the opcode that gets emitted for the
operation, and to know if any operand reconciliation is necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs to be able to reconcile different types of operands, where necessary.</p>

    <p>BASIC’s rules here are simple: we coerce the lesser-precision
value to the greater precision. In effect the rule is
INTEGER &lt; LONG &lt; SINGLE &lt; DOUBLE.</p>

    <p>STRING is not compatible with any other type — there’s no <nobr><code>"x" * 3 = "xxx"</code></nobr> here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs to be aware of what type a binary operation’s result will be in.</p>

    <p>I started out with the simple rule that the result will be of the same type
of the (reconciled) operands. This worked fine when I just had addition,
subtraction and multiplication; above, we add a LONG and an INTEGER, the INTEGER
gets promoted to a LONG, and the result is a LONG.</p>

    <p>Division broke this assumption, and resulted in the motivation for this
write-up.</p>

    <p>It needs to be able to pass that information up the compilation stack.</p>

    <p>Having calculated the result is a LONG, we need to return that information to
the procedure that compiled this expression, as it may make decisions based
on what’s left on the stack after evaluating it — such as in the first
dot-point here, or when assigning to a variable (which may be of any type, and
so require a specific coercion).</p>

</ul>

<p>This all kind of Just Worked, right up until I implemented division. I
discovered QuickBASIC actually has floating <em>and</em> integer division! Young me
was not aware of the backslash “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code>” operator (or any need for it, I suppose).
Floating division always returns a floating-point number, even when the inputs
are integral. Integer division always returns an integral, even when the inputs
are floating. The precision of the types returned in turn depends on that of the
input types.</p>

<p><center><em>Output types of each division operation given (reconciled) input type.</em></center></p>

<p>This presented a problem for the existing compiler, which assumed the result
would be the same type of the operands: having divided two INTEGERs, for
example, the bytecode emitted <em>assumed</em> there would be an INTEGER left on the
stack, and so further emitted code would carry that assumption.</p>

<p>Upon realising how division was supposed to work, the first place I made the
change was in the actual stack machine: correct the behaviour by performing
floating division when floating division was asked for, regardless of the
operand type. Thus dividing two INTEGERs pushed a SINGLE. The (Zig) machine then
promptly asserted upon hitting any operation on that value at all, expecting an
INTEGER there instead. (The future gateware implementation would probably not
assert, and instead produce confusing garbage.)</p>

<p>And so opened up a new kind of bug to look out for: a mismatch between (a)
the assumptions made by the compiler about the effects on the stack of the
operations it was emitting, and (b) the actual effects on the stack produced by
those operations running on the stack machine.</p>

<p>Rather than just some isolated tests (though short of creating some whole
contract interface between compiler and machine — maybe later), why not be
thorough while using the best witness for behaviour there is? Namely, the
compiler and stack machine themselves:</p>

<p>We go as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For all binary operations, enumerate all permutations of left- and right-hand
side types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each such triple, try compiling the binary operation with the “one”-value<sup id="fnref:one" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:one" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
of each type as its operands. (For integrals, it’s literally the number one.)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If we get a type error from this attempt, skip it — we don’t care that we can’t
divide a DOUBLE by a STRING, or whatever.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If not, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compileExpr</code> method returns to us the type of what it believes
the result to be. This is the same information used elsewhere in the
compiler to guide opcode and coercion decisions.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a stack machine, and run the compiled code.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Seeing as we didn’t actually compile a full statement, we expect the result
of the operation to be left sitting on the stack. (Normally a statement
would ultimately consume what’s been pushed.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assert that the type of the runtime value left on the stack is the same as
what the compiler expects!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I love how much this solution takes care of itself. While it lacks the
self-descriptive power of a more coupled approach to designing the compiler and
runtime, it lets the implementations remain quite clear and straightforward to
read. It also lets them stand alone, which is handy when a second implementation
of the runtime part is forthcoming, and is (by necessity) in a completely
different language environment.</p>

<p>There was greater value than just from floats, of course: relational operators
like equal “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>”, not equal “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&gt;</code>”, etc. all return INTEGERs 0 or -1, but
can operate with any combination of numeric types, or with pairs of STRINGs.
Bitwise operators like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XOR</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IMP</code> (!), etc. can operate with any
combination of numeric types, but coerce any floats to integrals before doing
so. I bet there’ll be more to uncover, too.</p>

<p>Hope this was fun to read!</p>
