      <p>Not much to report lately.  DDR continues to be fun, though I think given these
timings I’m past due for replacing the control board in the pad so I can get
better than 8ms resolution on steps.</p>

      <p><a href="https://remywiki.com/MAX_300">MAX 300</a> was the first<sup id="fnref:sakura" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sakura" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> level 10
song I cleared at the arcade.  I learned to play DDR with my older brother; I
distinctly recall the sensation of finally being better than him at a
game—whether it was Descent, StarCraft, anything, he always had such a lead.</p>

<p>I started DDR a bit later than him and had some catching up to do, but
eventually crossed the level 9 mark before he did.  It turned out rhythm games
would be a good place for me to excel.</p>

<p>He lives overseas now, and at some point got an <a href="https://www.maty-taneczne.pl">L-TEK DDR
pad</a>.  I was a bit envious, but felt the shipping
expense—far worse to Australia than the US—was too hard to justify.
Pandemic closing the gym made it muuuuuch more palatable, and plus it’d mean
I’d get to play DDR with my brother again in a way.</p>

<p>It’s been a very good way to get fit again, and hitting old milestones again is
a lot of fun.  I’ve done some other harder ones already, but today was the day
for clearing MAX<nobr> </nobr>300 again.  My scores are <em>much</em> better than my
13-year-old self’s, even though my endurance isn’t.</p>

      <p>I was alerted by a commenter that it’s been more than a year, now, since this
video dropped:</p>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83cEEyTuAMM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>COVID measures had already begun to be implemented; national borders shut, most
schools already closed.  Watching this press conference, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqDP8SnPVA0">a scene from The
Simpsons</a> played in my mind.  I’d
been getting a little comfy with a video editing program to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tzZYDXHHG4">IIDX
plays</a>, so I gave it a crack.</p>

<p>I don’t really have networks to tap, but Niki liked it so much she diligently
dropped it into comments on Facebook and Twitter replies wherever it seemed
appropriate.  Before I knew it, I had a moderately popular YouTube video.  It
entered the popular discourse when it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOK5JF5XGA">further
remixed</a>, but if you ask me, the
Trump oversamples are just kinda gross.</p>

<p>One thing that’s been interesting to see has been how the popularity of the
video corresponded with (literally) viral events:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-img/views.png" alt="A graph showing the views for the video" /></p>

<p>The three major events were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Late March, video released, Dan Andrews said “get on the beers”.</li>
  <li>Mid-May, first lockdown restrictions eased.</li>
  <li><a id="more"></a>October 26, Victoria recorded zero new cases/deaths for the
first time since June.  Dan reported that he “might go a little higher up the
shelf” than beers.</li>
</ul>

      <p>There’s a weird tension in programming — on the one hand, as you learn the
ropes, you (hopefully) learn very quickly that the problem is almost <em>always</em>
in your code, and not, say, the compiler, stdlib, kernel, etc.  This is usually
very correct; the people who’ve worked on those things have many times the
experience you did when you decided that there must be a bug in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf</code> or
something.</p>

<p>You’ll later realise you tried to print something through a pointer to a
stack-allocated variable that’s long since gone.  These accusations tend to
wane as you gain familiarity with your subject matter, and wax as you step out
into lands populated with ever more footguns, exposing more of the architecture
than you ever suspected was there.  (See also: the emails from me to the libev
mailing list in 2011.)</p>

<p>At some point, though, your journies will take you to places where things
aren’t so clear cut, and you’ll start to gain a sixth sense; a kind of visceral
experience that <em>things are not as they have been promised to be</em>.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a>A few weeks ago, that sixth sense whispered in my ear: “what
if, instead of your cruddy bootloader written in a pre-1.0 systems language for
a platform you don’t fully understand, it’s the 20 year-old project with 80,000
commits that’s wrong?”  And it was right.</p>

      <p>I recently received an <a href="https://inkplate.io">Inkplate</a>, and while I’m in the
middle of a few interesting projects already, I couldn’t let it sit there
unused.  Until I get a longer chunk of time to turn it into something really
nifty — maybe an embedded debugging helper of some kind — it can at least
mean I no longer need to have Mail.app open.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/kmlyink">kmlyink</a>’s README explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This repo has two parts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>a Dockerised IMAP proxy written in Ruby.</p>

      <p>It speaks plain HTTP, like an ESP can manage. It just fetches your Inbox
listing and puts it in JSON.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>a MicroPython module that connects to your wifi, speaks to the IMAP proxy,
and formats it into the display.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It took just a few hours to get it all up and running.  Delightful!</p>

by starting at the top of the Devicetree Specification page on the “Flattened

in mind, I still didn’t know what I yet needed out of it, just that I probably
needed to reference the DTB to get it.  (I <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/daintree/commit/1a65076a36301f0fb33748b8da644010a178b58e#diff-5e1ca02318cf3679c3aa9a422be7adfefe1fefdd76d297d676770edeacdb5e67R329-R349">kind of know better now</a>.)</p>

      <p>Note: this is a pretty long article which does a deep dive into breaking some amateur crypto.  I go on for quite a bit.  Make a cup of tea before reading, and get ready to read some code!</p>

<h3 id="introduction">introduction</h3>

<p>Everyone knows it.  Rolling your own cryptography is a terrible idea.  Here’s <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/03/cryptography_the_imp.html">Bruce Schneier writing about it in <strong>1999</strong></a>.  Here’s <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/18198/34825">an excellent answer on the Infosec Stack Exchange</a> about why you shouldn’t do it.  Here’s <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/05/amateurs_produc.html">another Scheiner post</a> with an excellent opening sentence.</p>

<p>This, then, is a post about a broken homegrown cryptosystem; namely, that used in <a href="https://www.codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a>, pre-2.2.  This version was current until the release of CodeIgniter 2.2, on <a href="https://ellislab.com/blog/entry/codeigniter-2.2.0-released">the 5th of June, 2014</a>, and you can still find sites on it today.</p>

<p>The attack described in the post depends on a lot of things to go right (or wrong, if you will); it’s not just that they used a bad cipher, but also the fact that they rolled their own session storage, and implemented a fallback, and a dozen other things.  This is probably typical for most bugs of this class; a bunch of bad decisions which aren’t thought through find their logical conclusion in complete insecurity.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a>Let’s get into it!</p>

      <p>I use <a href="http://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat</a>.  It’s an app where you can take a
photo or short (&lt; 10 second) video and send it to your friends who use the
service; they’ll then be able to see it, once, before it disappears forever.</p>

<p>Ostensibly, the app is for sexting, because there’s no fear that your photo
will get spread around (no forwarding/etc.) or retained for longer than you’d
like, but it <a href="http://survata.com/blog/is-snapchat-only-used-for-sexting-we-asked-5000-people-to-find-out/">seems like it’s not as much a sexter’s hangout as the media might
want you to
think</a>.</p>

<p>My circle of friends use it basically as an extension of weird Twitter – most
snaps I send and receive are strange angles of weird objects; the completely
mundane but somehow therapeutic (7 seconds of the camera pointed outside the
window of a tram, pointed at the ground moving below); or just closeups of
<a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=curtis+stone">Curtis Stone’s face</a>,
wherever we see him.</p>

<p><img style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 0px auto; display: block;" title="Curtis Stone. Ugh." src="/assets/post-img/stone.jpg" /></p>

<p><a id="more"></a>Of course, the promise that they won’t get retained is just that: a promise.
Since your phone receives this image and shows it to you at some point, it must
be downloaded by your phone.  If it can be downladed by the phone, it can be
downloaded by something else.  We decided to find out how.</p>

        Escapology: how, when and why to encode and escape

      <p>As programmers, we spend a lot of time just carting data from one place to
another.  Sometimes that’s the entire purpose of a program or library (data
conversion whatevers), but more often it’s just something that needs to happen
in the course of getting a certain task done.  When we’re sending a request,
using a library, executing templates or whatever, it’s important to be 100%
clear on the format of the data, which is a fancy way of saying how the data is
encoded.</p>

<p>Let’s do the tacky dictionary thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/encoding">encoding</a></strong> (<em>plural</em> encodings)</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>(computing) The way in which symbols are mapped onto bytes, e.g. in the
rendering of a particular font, or in the mapping from keyboard input into
visual text.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A conversion of plain text into a code or cypher form (for decoding by the
recipient).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="more"></a>I think these senses are a bit too specific—if your data is in a computer in
any form, then it’s already encoded.  The keyboard doesn’t even have to come
into it.</p>
