      <p>Not much to report lately.  DDR continues to be fun, though I think given these
timings I’m past due for replacing the control board in the pad so I can get
better than 8ms resolution on steps.</p>

      <p><a href="https://remywiki.com/MAX_300">MAX 300</a> was the first<sup id="fnref:sakura" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sakura" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> level 10
song I cleared at the arcade.  I learned to play DDR with my older brother; I
distinctly recall the sensation of finally being better than him at a
game—whether it was Descent, StarCraft, anything, he always had such a lead.</p>

<p>I started DDR a bit later than him and had some catching up to do, but
eventually crossed the level 9 mark before he did.  It turned out rhythm games
would be a good place for me to excel.</p>

<p>He lives overseas now, and at some point got an <a href="https://www.maty-taneczne.pl">L-TEK DDR
pad</a>.  I was a bit envious, but felt the shipping
expense—far worse to Australia than the US—was too hard to justify.
Pandemic closing the gym made it muuuuuch more palatable, and plus it’d mean
I’d get to play DDR with my brother again in a way.</p>

<p>It’s been a very good way to get fit again, and hitting old milestones again is
a lot of fun.  I’ve done some other harder ones already, but today was the day
for clearing MAX<nobr> </nobr>300 again.  My scores are <em>much</em> better than my
13-year-old self’s, even though my endurance isn’t.</p>

      <p>I was alerted by a commenter that it’s been more than a year, now, since this
video dropped:</p>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83cEEyTuAMM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>COVID measures had already begun to be implemented; national borders shut, most
schools already closed.  Watching this press conference, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqDP8SnPVA0">a scene from The
Simpsons</a> played in my mind.  I’d
been getting a little comfy with a video editing program to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tzZYDXHHG4">IIDX
plays</a>, so I gave it a crack.</p>

<p>I don’t really have networks to tap, but Niki liked it so much she diligently
dropped it into comments on Facebook and Twitter replies wherever it seemed
appropriate.  Before I knew it, I had a moderately popular YouTube video.  It
entered the popular discourse when it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOK5JF5XGA">further
remixed</a>, but if you ask me, the
Trump oversamples are just kinda gross.</p>

<p>One thing that’s been interesting to see has been how the popularity of the
video corresponded with (literally) viral events:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-img/views.png" alt="A graph showing the views for the video" /></p>

<p>The three major events were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Late March, video released, Dan Andrews said “get on the beers”.</li>
  <li>Mid-May, first lockdown restrictions eased.</li>
  <li><a id="more"></a>October 26, Victoria recorded zero new cases/deaths for the
first time since June.  Dan reported that he “might go a little higher up the
shelf” than beers.</li>
</ul>

        Knowing when to look past your code

      <p>There’s a weird tension in programming — on the one hand, as you learn the
ropes, you (hopefully) learn very quickly that the problem is almost <em>always</em>
in your code, and not, say, the compiler, stdlib, kernel, etc.  This is usually
very correct; the people who’ve worked on those things have many times the
experience you did when you decided that there must be a bug in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf</code> or
something.</p>

<p>You’ll later realise you tried to print something through a pointer to a
stack-allocated variable that’s long since gone.  These accusations tend to
wane as you gain familiarity with your subject matter, and wax as you step out
into lands populated with ever more footguns, exposing more of the architecture
than you ever suspected was there.  (See also: the emails from me to the libev
mailing list in 2011.)</p>

<p>At some point, though, your journies will take you to places where things
aren’t so clear cut, and you’ll start to gain a sixth sense; a kind of visceral
experience that <em>things are not as they have been promised to be</em>.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a>A few weeks ago, that sixth sense whispered in my ear: “what
if, instead of your cruddy bootloader written in a pre-1.0 systems language for
a platform you don’t fully understand, it’s the 20 year-old project with 80,000
commits that’s wrong?”  And it was right.</p>
