      <p>I recently received an <a href="https://inkplate.io">Inkplate</a>, and while I’m in the
middle of a few interesting projects already, I couldn’t let it sit there
unused.  Until I get a longer chunk of time to turn it into something really
nifty — maybe an embedded debugging helper of some kind — it can at least
mean I no longer need to have Mail.app open.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/kmlyink">kmlyink</a>’s README explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This repo has two parts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>a Dockerised IMAP proxy written in Ruby.</p>

      <p>It speaks plain HTTP, like an ESP can manage. It just fetches your Inbox
listing and puts it in JSON.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>a MicroPython module that connects to your wifi, speaks to the IMAP proxy,
and formats it into the display.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It took just a few hours to get it all up and running.  Delightful!</p>

      <p>Ever find yourself needing to implement a <a href="https://devicetree-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter5-flattened-format.html">device tree
blob</a>
(aka FDT, flattened device tree) parser and want to save yourself some time?

<h2 id="if-you-try-to-do-it-in-one-pass-you-will-hurt-yourself">If you try to do it in one pass, you will hurt yourself</h2>

<p><a id="more"></a>I charged headlong into writing
<a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/dtb.zig">dtb.zig</a>
by starting at the top of the Devicetree Specification page on the “Flattened
Devicetree (DTB)” Format” and reading down. It looked delightfully simple. Keep
in mind, I still didn’t know what I yet needed out of it, just that I probably
needed to reference the DTB to get it.  (I <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/daintree/commit/1a65076a36301f0fb33748b8da644010a178b58e#diff-5e1ca02318cf3679c3aa9a422be7adfefe1fefdd76d297d676770edeacdb5e67R329-R349">kind of know better now</a>.)</p>

        Breaking homegrown crypto

      <p>Note: this is a pretty long article which does a deep dive into breaking some amateur crypto.  I go on for quite a bit.  Make a cup of tea before reading, and get ready to read some code!</p>

<h3 id="introduction">introduction</h3>

<p>Everyone knows it.  Rolling your own cryptography is a terrible idea.  Here’s <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/03/cryptography_the_imp.html">Bruce Schneier writing about it in <strong>1999</strong></a>.  Here’s <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/18198/34825">an excellent answer on the Infosec Stack Exchange</a> about why you shouldn’t do it.  Here’s <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/05/amateurs_produc.html">another Scheiner post</a> with an excellent opening sentence.</p>

<p>This, then, is a post about a broken homegrown cryptosystem; namely, that used in <a href="https://www.codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a>, pre-2.2.  This version was current until the release of CodeIgniter 2.2, on <a href="https://ellislab.com/blog/entry/codeigniter-2.2.0-released">the 5th of June, 2014</a>, and you can still find sites on it today.</p>

<p>The attack described in the post depends on a lot of things to go right (or wrong, if you will); it’s not just that they used a bad cipher, but also the fact that they rolled their own session storage, and implemented a fallback, and a dozen other things.  This is probably typical for most bugs of this class; a bunch of bad decisions which aren’t thought through find their logical conclusion in complete insecurity.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a>Let’s get into it!</p>

        Snapchat: not for state secrets

      <p>I use <a href="http://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat</a>.  It’s an app where you can take a
photo or short (&lt; 10 second) video and send it to your friends who use the
service; they’ll then be able to see it, once, before it disappears forever.</p>

<p>Ostensibly, the app is for sexting, because there’s no fear that your photo
will get spread around (no forwarding/etc.) or retained for longer than you’d
like, but it <a href="http://survata.com/blog/is-snapchat-only-used-for-sexting-we-asked-5000-people-to-find-out/">seems like it’s not as much a sexter’s hangout as the media might
want you to
think</a>.</p>

<p>My circle of friends use it basically as an extension of weird Twitter – most
snaps I send and receive are strange angles of weird objects; the completely
mundane but somehow therapeutic (7 seconds of the camera pointed outside the
window of a tram, pointed at the ground moving below); or just closeups of
<a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=curtis+stone">Curtis Stone’s face</a>,
wherever we see him.</p>

<p><img style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 0px auto; display: block;" title="Curtis Stone. Ugh." src="/assets/post-img/stone.jpg" /></p>

<p><a id="more"></a>Of course, the promise that they won’t get retained is just that: a promise.
Since your phone receives this image and shows it to you at some point, it must
be downloaded by your phone.  If it can be downladed by the phone, it can be
downloaded by something else.  We decided to find out how.</p>

        Escapology: how, when and why to encode and escape
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2012-04-18T21:10:00+10:00" class="post-date">18 Apr 2012</time>

    
      <p>As programmers, we spend a lot of time just carting data from one place to
another.  Sometimes that’s the entire purpose of a program or library (data
conversion whatevers), but more often it’s just something that needs to happen
in the course of getting a certain task done.  When we’re sending a request,
using a library, executing templates or whatever, it’s important to be 100%
clear on the format of the data, which is a fancy way of saying how the data is
encoded.</p>

<p>Let’s do the tacky dictionary thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/encoding">encoding</a></strong> (<em>plural</em> encodings)</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>(computing) The way in which symbols are mapped onto bytes, e.g. in the
rendering of a particular font, or in the mapping from keyboard input into
visual text.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A conversion of plain text into a code or cypher form (for decoding by the
recipient).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="more"></a>I think these senses are a bit too specific—if your data is in a computer in
any form, then it’s already encoded.  The keyboard doesn’t even have to come
into it.</p>
