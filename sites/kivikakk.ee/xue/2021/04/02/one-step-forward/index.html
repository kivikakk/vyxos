<p>Oh, oh</p>

<p>There is something strange inside my head<br />
Something turns and runs from me<br />
If I look back now what would I see there following?</p>

<p>Can I withstand it and make it through to the light?<br />
If I turn back now then this will always follow</p>

<p>There is something strong inside my heart<br />
Something deep, unwavering<br />
If I breathe in now then I can’t find that part of me</p>

<p>Can I demand it and make it last through the night?<br />
If I wake up now then I can’t find the future</p>

<p>Oh, oh<br />
Oh, one step forward, forward<br />
Oh, oh<br />
Oh, one step forward, forward</p>

<p>Oh, oh<br />
Oh, one step forward, forward</p>

<p>‘cause the fear will take me if I let it in<br />
I must not, I must not, I must not, I must not let it in<br />
And the light will make me if I reach the end<br />
I will go, I will go, I will go, until it shines again</p>

<p>‘cause the fear will take me if I let it in<br />
I must not, I must not, I must not, I must not let it in<br />
And the light will make me if I reach the end<br />
I will go, I will go, I will go, until it shines again</p>

<p>Oh, oh<br />
Oh, one step forward, forward<br />
Oh, oh<br />
Oh, one step forward, forward</p>

<p>Oh, oh</p>
