    <h2>Inefficiences and insufficiencies: C++, others</h2>

<div id="post">
<p>Lately I’ve been <a href="https://github.com/nvdiao/gundrey">game programming</a>.  A
few things have been coming to mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir–Whorf
hypothesis</a> is totally
true when it comes to programming languages.</li>
  <li>Dynamically typed languages encourage a whole lot of waste.</li>
  <li>There’s some sweet spot of expressivity, low level and
non-shoot-yourself-in-the-footness in language that’s missing.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will attempt to expound.</p>

<p>The languages I end up using on a day-to-day basis tend to be higher level.
Non-scientific demonstration by way of my <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk">GitHub account’s contents at time of
writing</a>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>15 Ruby
9 OCaml
6 Go
6 Javascript
4 C
3 C++
2 Clojure
3 Perl
2 Haskell
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my professional career, I’ve concentrated on JavaScript, PHP, Erlang, Python
and C#.  The lowest level of these is, by far, Erlang.  Perhaps it’s fairer to
say that Erlang keeps me in check, perf-wise, more than any of the others.</p>

<p>So my mind has been a fairly high-level sort of mindset.  I’ve made occasional
trips to lower-level code, but there hasn’t been much of that lately,
particularly as I’ve changed jobs and needed to concentrate solely on work
stuff for a while.</p>

<p>Choosing C++ to write a game wasn’t too hard; it’s fairly standard in the
industry, and I know it quite well.  Bindings to libraries are plentiful, and
getting the same codebase compiling on Windows, OS X and Linux is a
well-understood problem that’s known to be solvable.</p>

<p>The thing is, C++ makes it abundantly clear when you’re doing something costly.
This is something that occurs particularly to me now as I’ve not done this
lower-level stuff in a while.</p>

<p>You wrote the copy constructor yourself, so you know exactly how expensive
pushing a bunch of objects into a <code class="highlighter-rouge">vector</code> is.  You chose a <code class="highlighter-rouge">vector</code>, and not a
list, so you know exactly why you don’t want to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">push_front</code> so many
times.  You’re creating a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ostringstream</code> to turn all this junk into a string:
it has a cost.  Are we putting this on the stack or in the heap?  Shall we use
reference counting?</p>

<p>You make hundreds of tiny decisions all the time you’re using it; ones which
are usually being abstracted away from you in higher level languages.  It’s why
they’re higher level.</p>

<p>And that’s basically all I have to say on that: the language makes you feel the
cost of what you choose to do.  Going to use a pointer?  Better be sure the
object doesn’t get moved around.  Maybe I’ll just store an ID to that thing and
store lookups in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code>.  How costly is the hashing function on the map key?
You add such a lookup table in Ruby without a moment’s notice; here, you’re
forced to consider your decision a moment.  Every time you access the data,
you’re reminded as well; it’s not something that ever goes out of mind.</p>

<p>Moreover, the ahead-of-time compilation means you can’t do costly runtime
checks or casts unless you <em>really</em> want to (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">dynamic_cast</code>), but again,
the cost of doing so means you’ll never be caught unaware by slowing
performance.  In many (dynamic) higher level languages, basically every
operation is laced with these.</p>

<p>So it’s suited for games programming, because performance is usually pretty
important, and the language keeping performance on your mind means it’s not
hard to consistently achieve high performance.</p>

<p>But C++’s deficiencies <a href="http://www.fefe.de/c++/c++-talk.pdf">are also
well-documented</a>.  It’s awful.  It’s
waiting to trip you up at every turn.  After re-reading those talk slides, I
figured I’d just port the code to C – until I remembered how much I used
<code class="highlighter-rouge">std::string</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::vector</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::list</code>, and moreover, enjoyed the type- and
memory-safety they all bring.  I’m not particularly fond of giving that up and
implementing a bunch of containers myself, or using generic containers and
throwing away my type checks.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I’m after C with templates for structs (and associated functions),
but I’m not sure yet.  If you think I want C++, you probably need to <a href="http://www.fefe.de/c++/c++-talk.pdf">re-read
those notes</a>.</p>

<p>The other solution is to only use as much of C++ as I like, and that’s
basically what I do – but the language is still waiting to trip me up, no
matter how much I try not to use it.</p>

<p>Time to think a bit about what the issues at hand really are.</p>
