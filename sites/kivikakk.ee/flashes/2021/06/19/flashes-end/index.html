<p>Quoting “(un)monitored”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have no idea if anyone reads this. It <em>is</em> linked from one of our blogs, but you have to look to even find that blog, let alone notice the link. […] On the other hand, <em>because</em> of this, I am able to write more openly. If I knew I had any kind of readership at all, I might not write some things, or might write differently.</p>

<p>A reader reached out and, though I was extremely flattered at first, now I can’t feel the same way about writing here.</p>

<p>I was never meant to be someone in your story—I was meant to be an exhibit of open life, to be appreciated, not touched.</p>

<p>Godspeed.</p>
