  <p>I’ve been deleting hundreds of accounts and cleaning up many more while
preparing for the move, and I found I have an npm account with one (1)
package, last published May 2012 (!): <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/allium">allium</a>,
a parser for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)#Gherkin_language">“Gherkin” syntax</a>
used to define Cucumber BDD tests, back when that was all the rage.</p>

<p>The README captured by npm refers to the literate source code as once published
on GitHub Pages. That was long ago, but I figured it might be fun to look at
again. And it is! Have look: <a href="https://f.hrzn.ee/allium/">https://f.hrzn.ee/allium/</a></p>
