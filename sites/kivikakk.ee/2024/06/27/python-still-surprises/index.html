<meta name="description" content="After the better part of 20 years working with Python, it still managed to surprise me today. I’m so used to languages treating x += y et al. as pure sugar for x = x + y that it skipped my mind that some don’t. I’m not surprised that you can override them separately in some languages (e.g. I simply assume this to be the case in C++, and on checking it turns out to be true — but that seems fair enough given the scope of the language), but I really am so accustomed to them being only sugar in Ruby that I assumed the same would hold, at least in effect, in Python. Thus my surprise on some_list += x modifying some_list in place (unlike some_list = some_list + x), but once observed, I realised there’d be a separately-overridden operator function — namely __iadd__ — and so I figured it “had” to be that way.

So it’s just a matter of convention." />

  <p>After the better part of 20 years working with Python, it still managed to
surprise me today.</p>

<p>I’m so used to languages treating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x += y</code> et al. as pure sugar for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x = x + y</code>
that it skipped my mind that some don’t.</p>

<p>I’m not surprised that you <em>can</em> override them separately in some languages (e.g.
I simply assume this to be the case in C++, and on checking it turns out to
be true — but that seems fair enough given the scope of the language), but I
really am so accustomed to them being only sugar in Ruby that I assumed the same
would hold, at least in effect, in Python.</p>

<p>Thus my surprise on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">some_list += x</code> modifying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">some_list</code> in place (unlike
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">some_list = some_list + x</code>), but once observed, I realised there’d be a
separately-overridden operator function — namely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__iadd__</code> — and so I
figured it “had” to be that way.</p>

<p>Or did it? I then found myself assuming it’s because these operators can’t
actually reassign the receiver, but in fact they can and do: the return value is
what’s assigned to the LHS. So it’s just a matter of convention.</p>
