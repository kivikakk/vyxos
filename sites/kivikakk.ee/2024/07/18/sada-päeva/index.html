<meta name="description" content="Yesterday was our 100th day in Estonia. Taking a little bit of stock of what we’ve managed: Visited the 4 largest cities in the country. Rented an apartment in the biggest one! Furnished what the apartment didn’t come with. Shipped our things from Australia. (Maybe a month off those arriving.) Got our motorcycles; put 900km on each. Got medium-term visa for A, and long-term one applied for. Got our medications prescribed locally. Financial/bureaucratic overhead. Changed my name and got new ID. Got onto a good family doctor’s list. Kept in touch with families and psychologists. Vaccinations. Saw the border. Went to a cat café. Went to sauna. Concluded jaanipäev with clothes smelling deeply of bonfire. Went to a live show (Estonian). Went to a live show (non-Estonian). Walked about 500km. Taken a lot of public transport. Met a range of people. Spoken quite a bit of Estonian. Kept up with projects. Finished a diary! Grew a lot." />
