  <p>i want to try to describe how i relate to my own identity. i don’t know how other
people feel about their identities. it’s not a feeling you can transmit. you can’t put your hand
on someone else’s and understand how they perceive it. i have no idea if this experiment is
even vaguely feasible, but i want to try.</p>

<p>when i turn my attention inward and look for it, there’s nothing. what i grasp for first
is a label, something with a shape which it might fit into. there’s a couple of these that come
to mind almost immediately: programmer, trans girl, anarchist … but well, that’s the thing.
i’ve been all of these and none of these at the same time. some days i don’t “feel” a label but
the criteria fit anyway, because of how labels and identity work — by social construction. you
can only be a programmer in a world that knows what programming is, that distinguishes it
from something else, and that distinguishing defines its criteria. other days i feel it but the
criteria don’t exactly fit. being a trans girl is one of those thing. the problem with these
criteria is that they are indeed socially constructed, meaning they’re malleable. and as a
member of society, it’s not like the construction has nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>i guess the thing is that, maybe more than most, my identity is slippery. some parts
remain fixed for longer periods of time than others, but as far as i can tell there’s nothing
that remains indefinitely. this seems to set me apart from other people. or at least, people
without bpd.</p>

<p>one of the worst parts of a slippery identity is that it’s also difficult for me to grasp
much of the time. even i won’t know where part of me has gone, where part of me came
from, when to expect that something might appear or disappear. sometimes i wake up and
there’s something that was core to me that’s just … vanished. i can’t explain it any better
than that. maybe it’ll be back. maybe it won’t. maybe something similar will take its place.</p>

<p>in times like these, consistent action arises out of consistent values. i don’t see values
as a part of identity. i think people sometimes choose to make their values their identity, but
i don’t believe identifying a certain way is a requirement for holding a certain value. i’ll
never believe less in universal human rights, queer rights, the fundamental unjustness of
capital, etc. but some days i might think the term “activist” fits more than others. indeed,
some days i will highly associate with it, and others not at all.</p>

<p>so when i cast my vision inward.. i see no identity at all, until i pause and let my eyes
adjust, and then i see a million. i don’t know how to convey this. how much it feels like i’m
at odds with a world that expects me to remain static, to possess a single identity and not a
dynamic process of identity. how much that can make me feel bad for not conforming with
their expectations; how that can manifest as disappointment and disgust and self-hate, none
of which helps, but instead pushes me toward repression.</p>

<p>i find it hard to say i’m one person. it’s hard to say i possess “an identity”, to relate to
“my identity” when the singular is utterly dissonant here.</p>

<p>it’s hard to say i relate to identity.</p>
