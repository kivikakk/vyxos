  <p>the blanket on top is red, soft, velvety. i don’t know what it’s made of. it’s the kind of
material that isn’t especially thick, but feels warm. too warm under it and you sweat easily
for some reason.</p>

<p>i think it came from kairi, it rather, that she brought it with her with belfast and then
didn’t want to take it with her when she moved out. almost everything like that i’ve gotten rid
of, donated, given to a friend. but not this. not because it reminds me of her. it’s just a really
nice blanket.</p>

<p>there’s a purple blanket underneath it. same size, purple not red, and just a slightly
different material. i’ve been snuggled up in it in many different places; couches, chairs, beds.
it doesn’t mean anything specific. it’s just a nice blanket.</p>

<p>under that, a sheet. i had no idea you were “supposed” to sleep under a sheet for most
of my life. i didn’t understand the concept of flat sheets whatsoever; fitted ones worked
better, so why did they exist? it’s microfibre or some fancy word like that, which is another
way of saying $20 at woolworths.</p>

<p>this place feels like something i’ve slowly reclaimed.</p>
