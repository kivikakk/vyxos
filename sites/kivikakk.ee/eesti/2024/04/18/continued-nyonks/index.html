  <p>It’s been a week since I last wrote. Some more little bits and pieces.</p>

<p>The DPDR/dissociation has become even bit worse; somehow still keeping it
together. Watching The Princess Bride with Annie last night helped.</p>

<p>Miscellany:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Presented to the Police and Border Guard Board office to renew my ID card. Sat
down in front of the worker once my number was called and asked, “kas te
räägite inglise keelt?” (do you speak English?). With almost a tinge of pride,
she replied, “ei!” (no!). It took everything in me not to <a href="https://youtu.be/CgjMfaQ94Co?si=Qig3i8dlKwjSIOC3&amp;t=117">burst out
laughing</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There’s an oddity in that I can pronounce Estonian very well, despite not
really knowing much of it (i.e. reading out text, like from a menu or Google
Translate or whatever, I sound semi-native, but actually producing that text
myself I’m nowhere near yet). This makes for fun situations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a new home :) An r/eesti comment mentioned someone once found an
apartment in Tallinn on day 5 and was moved in by day 7. That was encouraging,
if a little unrealistic-seeming. But nope: we inspected ours on day 4 (!), and
moved in on day 8. Now we can ship our boxes from Australia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Food’s so nice here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sure it’s 2° outside, that’s no problem, but then you walk into any building
and it’s 22° and you’re shedding layers as fast as you can. Other people just
seem not to?! I don’t get it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The worst part for me is that, even with all our apartment floor-heating
turned “off” (or as off as you can, which is to say, the set point is set
lower than the actual point), we’re on the top of the building, so it’s over
20° regardless. This is troublesome at night, and the street noise might be
a bit much to open the windows, but using the aircon when it’s below zero
outside feels a bit …</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Also, sharing a bedroom for the first time in so many years is a strange
experience, like I’m cosplaying being a different kind of adult.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public transport’s so nice here — it’s already happened that we’ve taken
train+bus+tram all in the one day just out of convenience.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Not that I’ve worked out how to get the free transit for locally-registered
residents working on my Ühiskaart yet.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Is it only on TLT-operated busses? Is that it?? The information’s all very
vague.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>DISREGARD THAT I S—eem to have gotten it on a further attempt with the
card reader.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It just started snowing!?!!?</p>
  </li>
