  <p>I recently received an <a href="https://inkplate.io">Inkplate</a>, and while I’m in the
middle of a few interesting projects already, I couldn’t let it sit there
unused.  Until I get a longer chunk of time to turn it into something really
nifty — maybe an embedded debugging helper of some kind — it can at least
mean I no longer need to have Mail.app open.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/kmlyink">kmlyink</a>’s README explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This repo has two parts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>a Dockerised IMAP proxy written in Ruby.</p>

      <p>It speaks plain HTTP, like an ESP can manage. It just fetches your Inbox
listing and puts it in JSON.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>a MicroPython module that connects to your wifi, speaks to the IMAP proxy,
and formats it into the display.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It took just a few hours to get it all up and running.  Delightful!</p>
